This extension adds data visualization to RT ticket
search results. It uses Timeline, by Simile.

http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/

This version links to the Timeline javascript API
hosted at MIT. (So it won't work if your browser
can't get to the site. But at least you will almost
always be using the latest. :)
